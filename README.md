## Installations:

Installing libraries may not always go as planned. To avoid these installations causing issues for your other projects, I recommend you doing the installation in a virtual environment or anaconda environment. I had Python 3.X already installed, I assume Python 2.X won't work.

### Tensorflow2: 

```
$ pip install tensorflow
```

### Pillow:
```
$ pip install pillow
```

## Demo:
```
$ python pretrained.py
```

You will see some warnings related to CUDA, you can ignore them.
